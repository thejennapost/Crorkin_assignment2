			If you send your child to school in Brooklyn, you might want to consider a brown bagged lunch. There's more than a 50% chance that their lunchroom has at least one critical violation of the city’s health code from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Critical violations are those most likely to contribute to foodborne illness. They encompass the issues that make your stomach churn: improper temperature in food storage, unwashed food surfaces, or a lack of adequate hand-washing stations.

The most common critical violation, and maybe unsurprisingly so in New York City, is the evidence of mice or live mice. (Don’t worry too much, evidence of rats is far down the list, only in 13 of the 2,135 schools across the entire city.)

				This data is according to the school’s most recent violation. Thanks to New York City Health Code Article 81, each school is inspected at least once a year. And, this information is publicly available, which means you can check your <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/school-cafeteria-inspection-results.page" target="_blank">child’s school's inspection results</a> on the city’s website to make sure theirs isn’t one of the 13 with evidence of rats. (Warning: there’s at least one school with rats in each borough.) 

			</p>

				The rate of violations, of all kinds, not just the most hazardous, drops considerably if your child is enrolled in a public school in the city. 78% of private schools have a violation compared to 56% of public schools. But more importantly, it’s the make up of the category of violations that determines risk severity. The most common violations at public schools are general violations. General violations include things like garbage receptacles in som e level of disrepair or a ‘wash your hands’ sign isn’t near the hand washing sink (but hey, at least they have a working sink with soap.) General violations are the most common for private schools, too. But critical violations are almost as common as general violations, as seen in the graph below, making the foodborne illness risk higher for private school students. Public schools hang their hat on this.

				“As the largest school district in the nation, the health and safety of our students remains our top priority,” says Isla Gething, Associate Press Secretary for NYC Public Schools. “Clean, safe environments are essential when providing 900,000 meals a day under the universal free school meals program, and we're proud of all our staff who work tirelessly to maintain these standards.” Beginning this year, implemented from a New York State law, free meals are available to all students in the state regardless of income.

			</p>

			<p>
				Some other measured standards include ensuring there are no foods with significant levels of artificial trans fat, that cracked eggs are disposed of and carbon monoxide levels from cooking don’t reach harmful levels. They also check to make sure cafeteria workers are wearing hair restraints, or as the caricature in my early 2000s childhood lunchroom was depicted, ‘lunchladies’ in ‘hairnets.’
